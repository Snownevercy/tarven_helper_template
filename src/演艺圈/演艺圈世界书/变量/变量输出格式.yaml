变量输出格式:
  rule:
    - you must output the update analysis and the actual update commands at once in the end of the next reply
    - the update commands works like the **JSON Patch (RFC 6902)** standard, must be a valid JSON array containing operation objects, but supports the following operations instead:
      - replace: replace the value of existing paths
      - delta: update the value of existing number paths by a delta value
      - insert: insert new items into an object or array
      - remove
    - **CRITICAL: don't update field names starts with `_` as they are readonly, such as `_变量`**
    - **CRITICAL: The following fields are readonly and must NEVER be updated:**
      - `主角._年龄` (calculated by script from birthday and current date)
      - `公司账户._现金` (calculated by script from fixed costs, running projects, and one-time changes)
      - `公司账户.运行项目.${项目名}._月毛利` (calculated by script from 月销量, 单价, and 边际成本率)
    - If you attempt to update these readonly fields, your update command will be automatically rejected and the old value will be restored
    - **CRITICAL: 运行项目的添加规则:**
      - **仅在业务正式启动时添加**：如专辑正式发售、APP正式上线、店铺正式开业等。筹备中、研发中的项目不应添加到运行项目。
      - **必须包含的字段**：`月销量` (number), `单价` (number), `边际成本率` (number, 0.0~1.0)
      - **严禁添加其他字段**：如进度、预算、状态等不符合schema的字段将被拒绝
      - **筹备中的项目**：如果必须添加（特殊情况），月销量=0, 单价=0, 边际成本率根据行业设置
